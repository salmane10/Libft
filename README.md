DESCRIPTION
This project is my very first project as a student at 1337 BG. 
i recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions will be used during my whole cursus.

INTRODUCTION
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them,  
i create my own library and it will be
helpful since i will use it in my next C school assignments.

Common Instructions
• My project must be written in C.
• My project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If I have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and I will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.
• My functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, my project will be
considered non-functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
• All heap-allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated.
• If the subject requires it, I must submit a Makefile which will compile my
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, use
cc, and my Makefile must not relink.
• My Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean, and
re.
• To turn in bonuses to my project, I must include a rule bonus in my Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if
the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation
is done separately.
• If my project allows me to use my libft, I must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile into a libft folder with its associated Makefile. My project’s
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
• I am encouraged to create test programs for my project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give me a chance
to easily test my work and my peers’ work. I will find those tests especially
useful during my defense. Indeed, during defense, I am free to use my tests
and/or the tests of the peer I am evaluating.
• I must submit my work to my assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade my work, it will be done.
